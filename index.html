            <h2>The Burren</h2>
            <p>
               Working out of the Burren College of Art, students 
               are immersed in a unique limestone landscape. The 
               Burren has the most biodiversity in Ireland and 
               contains 1100 out of Ireland's 1400 plant species.
               These plant species include both Arctic-Alpine and
               Mediterranean species.
               There are even forms of plant-life that can only 
               be found here.      

               This setting serves to inspire students to imagine ideas for their final projects.
               The final projects are worked on for the majority of the time in Ireland, allowing 
               for in-depth exploration of their topics. Students may work in any media of their
               choice for this project. They are also able to access a number of on-site facilities 
               including a printmaking studio, a digital lab, and 3d makerspace. Each student also
               has access to a studio space that is open 24/7 to work in and to display their projects.

            <h2>Hiking is in Your Backyard</h2>
            <p>
            From majestic cliffs to towering stoneforts, 
            students are taken on a variety of hikes and trips around 
            Ireland. These trips help students connect their art to 
            the unique landscape and connect what they learn about Irish 
            history to the strucures and architectural details they see.
            They also keep journals of sketches, paingtings, notes, 
            and collections of objects to record their experiences 
            throughout the trip.

        <h2>Ballyvaughan</h2>
        <p>
            Only a short walk from campus is the charming 
            downtown Ballyvaughan. Ballyvaughan is a small town with 
            picturesque store fronts. There is also a weekly farmer's 
            market and craft fair to stock up on artisanal goods from 
            delectible fresh bread to locally sourced honey and goat's 
            milk soap.

            <h2>Find Balance in Nature</h2>
            <p>
                Through the guided hikes and projects in the environment students are encouraged to 
                reflect on their experiences. These reflections and analysis of systems and patterns 
                in the landscape are utilized in projects and their journals which are maintained 
                throughout the duration of the program.
